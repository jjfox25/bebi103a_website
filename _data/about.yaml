  Modeling Caulobacter Growth
authors: >
  Jonathan Fox, Eugene Li
Abstract: >
  Growth of a colony of bacteria is modeled as an
  exponential process in which each division doubles the
  number of bacteria present. However, the growth model for an
  individual bacterium may be different from the colony as a
  whole. In this study, we use data of single bacterium growth
  from the 2014 PNAS publication from Iyer-Biswas et al.
  titled "Scaling laws governing stochastic growth and
  division of single bacterial cells." In this study, the
  authors use image tracking and a flow cell culture system to
  track the change in area of individual Caulobacter
  crescentus cells as they undergo cell division. In this
  study, we perform maximum likelihood estimation to evaluate
  both the linear and exponential growth model of individual
  bacteria. The median Akaike weight for the linear growth
  model was found to be 0.8 while the median Akaike weight for
  the exponential growth model was found to be 0.2. From these
  results, we show that the linear growth model is a better
  model for individual bacterial growth. 

Summary:  >
  We perform maximum likelihood estimation on data of individual
  bacterial growth. We determine that the linear growth model is
  a better model of individual bacterial growth.
